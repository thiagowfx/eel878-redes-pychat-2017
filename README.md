Instructions
------------

* Ensure you have `python3` installed and in your system `PATH`.
* To start a server, run `make server`, or `./pychat.py --mode=server`.
* To start a client, run `make client`, or `./pychat.py --mode=client`.
* If you want to {start on, connect to} a different hostname or port, then run
  the `pychat.py` binary directly with the appropriate command-line flags.
  To see its usage, run `./pychat.py -h` or `./pychat.py --help`.
* A log file is automatically created and written to `pychat.log`.
